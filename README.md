## ConfigureAwait

When we use the `await` keyword to asynchronously wait for a task to complete, the current synchronization context is captured and used to resume the execution of the rest of the method after the awaited task completes. 

This means that if the awaited task completes on a different `thread` than the one that started the method. However, in some cases, it may not be necessary or desirable to resume on the original synchronization context. 

We can use the ConfigureAwait(false) method to explicitly specify that the continuation of the method can run on any thread, rather than the original synchronization context. This can help to improve performance and reduce the risk of deadlocks or other synchronization issues.

`ConfigureAwait(false)` can be used for improving performance and reduce the risk of synchronization issues in cases where the continuation of the method does not need to run on the original synchronization context.
